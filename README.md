# HumanCast
HumanCast is a new app for Android that delivers accurate weather data, personalized forecasts, and tongue-in-cheek humor from your new weather pal, Brellbert.

# Goals For This Project

- Display Up-To-Date Weather Data
    - Use apparent temperature (because nothing else matters :P)
    - Note the impact of weather conditions (Super sunny days, rain, etc.)
    - Build a graph showing the day
    
- Allow feedback from the user day-to-day (Because, really, "cold" isn't the same for everyone. Looking at you, shorts-in-the-snow dude).
- Sync Data To The Cloud
- Have a lighthearted and clear UI
