# HumanCast
First-time Android project to provide a customized weather experience!

# Goals For This Project

- Display Up-To-Date Weather Data
    - Use the windchill formula from [here](https://sciencing.com/calculate-relative-accuracy-6069718.html)
    - Note the impact of weather conditions (Super sunny days, rain, etc.)
    - Possibly build a graph showing the day
    
- Allow feedback from the user day-to-day (Because, really, "cold" isn't the same for everyone. Looking at you, shorts-in-the-snow dude).
- Sync Data To The Cloud
- Have a lighthearted and clear UI
