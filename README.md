# HumanCast
First-time Android project to provide a customized weather experience!

# Goals For This Project
- Display Up-To-Date Weather Data
- Allow feedback from the user day-to-day (because, really, "cold" isn't the same for everyone. Looking at you, shorts-in-the-snow dude).
- Sync Data To The Cloud
- Have a lighthearted and clear UI
